To add a new feature without messing up the old code, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Branch**: Start by creating a new branch in your version control system (like Git). This branch will be dedicated to implementing the new feature.

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

2. **Implement the New Feature**: Write the code for your new feature in this branch. Make sure to keep the changes isolated from the existing codebase.

3. **Test Your Changes**: Before merging the new feature into the main codebase, thoroughly test it to ensure it works as expected and doesn't introduce any regressions.

4. **Merge the New Feature**: Once you're satisfied with the new feature, merge the changes back into the main branch.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

5. **Resolve Conflicts (if any)**: If there are any conflicts during the merge, resolve them carefully. Pay attention to not accidentally undo any existing functionality.

6. **Test Again**: After merging, test the entire codebase again to make sure the new feature didn't break anything.

7. **Commit and Push**: Finally, commit your changes and push them to your remote repository.

```bash
git commit -m "Added new feature"
git push origin main
```

By following these steps, you can add new features to your project without messing up the old codebase. Each feature will be developed in its own branch, keeping the main codebase clean and stable.
